Connectivity in India is *mostly* great… until you step into a lift or metro. That’s why I build offline-first by default. My toolkit:

- **Session cache with intent:** cache the screen the user just touched; hydrate silently when the device breathes again.  
- **Optimistic UI with honest state:** update immediately, but show a monochrome “Syncing…” chip. On failure it turns accent red with a retry affordance.  
- **Conflict strategy agreed early:** last-write-wins? merge? user prompt? Deciding with product saves midnight debates.  
- **Degraded telemetry:** log offline attempts + retries so we know which experiences truly hurt when the network drops.  

Stacking those habits routinely earns us reviews like “works even on patchy Wi‑Fi,” which is the best UX compliment a mobile team can get.
